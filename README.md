# SkinliciousWeb
This is the very first web I have programmed from scratch. The whole design and logo are original. The logo is under the Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license, but you can use the design of the logo as reference or inspiration for a similar or different project. You can check more about project on my Behance profile.
